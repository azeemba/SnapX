Replacement for Windows/Aero Snap.

I like the built-in Snap but needed something with more options when I got a 34" monitor to replace two 24" monitors.  (I don't want to replace four horizontal snaps with two extra-wide snaps.)

####Standards####
*	Use the same shortcut keys as Snap (Win+_arrow key_) and the keys must perform the same functions
*	If a shortcut key function must be changed, the new function must be intuitively similar
*	If new shortcut keys must be introduced, the new keys must be intuitively similar to the originals

####Usage####
*	Win+Left
	*	If not snapped, snap
	*	If snapped, move snap left
*	Win+Right
	*	If not snapped, snap
	*	If snapped, move snap right
*	Win+Up
	*	If not snapped, snap and increase snap width by 1
	*	If snapped, increase snap width by 1
*	Win+Down
	*	If not snapped, minimize
	*	If snapped, decrease snap width by 1
	*	If snapped and current width is 1, restore
